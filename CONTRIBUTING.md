## 📁 Project structure

```
verificaEs/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py              
│   ├── routers/             # API endpoints

## ✅ Guidelines

- Every new validator must have its corresponding tests in `tests/`
- Validators go in `app/validators/`
- Endpoints go in `app/routers/`
- Keep functions small and focused on one thing
- No external libraries for validation logic — pure Python only

---

## 🤝 Code of conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Constructive feedback only
- Any form of harassment will not be tolerated
